ExpDetails/Archive — Archived Experiment Description Files
==========================================================

Overview
--------
This folder contains experiment description MAT files that are no longer
active but are retained for reference. Files stored here do not appear in the
GetInfoGUI experiment description dropdown.

To restore an archived description to active use, move the corresponding
MAT file back to the ExpDetails/ folder. It will then appear in the
GetInfoGUI dropdown the next time the GUI is launched.

NOTE: if a file of the same name already exists in ExpDetails/, you must
manually resolve the conflict before restoring the archived copy.
